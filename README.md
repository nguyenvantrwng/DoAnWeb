<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/logo1.png" alt="Product Name Screen Shot" width="300" height="200">
</p>

There are many powerful AI tools available online that convert text into speech, music, images, and videos. However, we noticed that there isnâ€™t yet a single platform that conveniently integrates all these features into one easy-to-use website.

As students from the University of Information Technology, we are determined to build a multifunctional website where users can fully experience the power of AI in creating and processing multimedia content.

Our goal is not merely to create a simple tool, but to deliver a seamless creative experience that helps users save time and make the most of cutting-edge AI technologies.

We are committed to continuously developing and expanding the project, and we warmly welcome feedback and contributions from the community to improve together.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8 or higher**  
  Make sure Python is installed on your machine. Check by running:

  ```sh
  python --version
  ```

  or

  ```sh
  python3 --version
  ```

  If you don't have Python installed or your version is below 3.8, please download and install it from
  https://www.python.org/downloads/

  â€¢ pip (Python package manager)
  Usually installed with Python. Verify installation by running:

  ```sh
  pip --version
  ```

  â€¢ It is recommended to activate the virtual environment before installation to avoid affecting other projects.

  on windows

  ```sh
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

  on macOS/Linux:

  ```sh
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Get a free API Key at [https://fal.ai/](https://fal.ai/)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git git clone https://github.com/nguyenvantrwng/DoAnWeb.git
   ```
3. Install the necessary libraries

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   or

   ```sh
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Notes
   </br>
   Always activate the virtual environment before installing packages or running the project to avoid conflicts.

   You can generate a requirements.txt file by running:

   ```sh
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```

4. Enter your API in `Flask`
